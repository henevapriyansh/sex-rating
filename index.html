    <h1>AI Sex Rater — Comprehensive Performance Analysis</h1>
    <p class="intro">This tool provides a detailed analysis of your sexual encounter based on a variety of physiological and performance metrics. Enter accurate data below to receive a score out of 100, a breakdown of key factors, and tailored recommendations to enhance your experience. All data is processed locally in your browser, ensuring complete privacy. The scoring system uses evidence-based ranges (e.g., average erect penis length ~5.16 inches, intercourse duration 7-13 minutes) to evaluate performance objectively.</p>

Solutions for length mismatch: if penis significantly exceeds comfortable depth, use shallow thrusting, angled entry targeting anterior wall rather than straight cervical contact, positions like spooning limiting depth, or donut-shaped rings limiting penetration. If notably shorter, use positions maximizing depth like legs-on-shoulders, doggy with arched back, or reverse cowgirl. Girth mismatches: if too large, extend foreplay for maximum accommodation and use generous lubrication; if narrower, try positions creating tighter grip like crossed-legs missionary.`);

    <h3>Session Narrative Summary:</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05em;">
      This intimate encounter commenced with ${data.foreplay} minutes of arousal-building foreplay, employing sensual touches, verbal intimacy, and focused stimulation to prepare both bodies for intercourse. The transition to penetration initiated ${data.duration} minutes of rhythmic coupling, characterized by ${Math.round(data.thrusts)} total thrusts delivered at an average cadence of ${Math.round(data.thrustSpeed)} strokes per minute—${data.thrustSpeed > 90 ? 'a vigorous, high-intensity tempo' : data.thrustSpeed > 75 ? 'a moderate, sustainable rhythm' : 'a slower, deliberate pace'}. 
      
      The male partner achieved ${data.maleOrgasms} ${data.maleOrgasms === 1 ? 'orgasm' : 'orgasms'}, releasing approximately ${data.ejaculationVolume}ml of ejaculate in ${data.maleOrgasms === 1 ? 'a climactic surge' : 'successive waves'}, while the female partner experienced ${data.femaleOrgasms} ${data.femaleOrgasms === 1 ? 'peak of pleasure' : data.femaleOrgasms > 1 ? 'cascading orgasms' : 'session without orgasmic release'}. This represents ${data.femaleOrgasms === 0 ? 'the documented orgasm gap requiring attention' : data.femaleOrgasms >= data.maleOrgasms ? 'excellent orgasmic equity' : 'moderate orgasmic disparity'}.
      
      Position variety spanned ${data.positions} different configurations, with penetration averaging ${data.penetrationDepth} inches—${data.vaginalDepth ? (data.penetrationDepth > data.vaginalDepth ? 'exceeding comfortable vaginal depth, suggesting need for shallower angles' : 'appropriately matched to anatomical accommodation') : 'within typical aroused vaginal range of 4-6 inches'}. The encounter unfolded in environmental conditions of ${data.roomTemp}°C, ${data.roomTemp >= 20 && data.roomTemp <= 24 ? 'providing optimal comfort for sustained activity' : 'creating suboptimal thermal conditions potentially affecting performance'}.
      
      Following climax, the refractory recovery period extended ${data.refractoryTime} minutes, ${data.refractoryTime < avgRefractory ? 'demonstrating impressive recovery speed' : data.refractoryTime > avgRefractory + 20 ? 'indicating extended recovery needs' : 'aligning with age-appropriate expectations'}, allowing physiological return to baseline before potential additional rounds. The complete session, including all phases, consumed ${data.totalSessionTime.toFixed(1)} minutes of intimate connection.

    </ul>

    <h3>Research Context & Benchmarking:</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
      Your performance is contextualized against extensive peer-reviewed sexual health research including: Veale et al.'s 2015 systematic review of 15,521 men establishing global penis size norms; Waldinger's 2005 multinational stopwatch study of 491 couples determining median intercourse duration; Frederick et al.'s 2018 analysis of orgasm frequency showing persistent gaps; Herbenick et al.'s 2020-2024 surveys on position preferences and satisfaction correlates; and numerous studies on cardiovascular load, caloric expenditure, and refractory period variations.
      
      Individual variation vastly exceeds population averages—these metrics serve as reference points, not rigid standards. Sexual satisfaction research consistently shows communication, emotional connection, and mutual respect predict satisfaction far more reliably than any physical measurement. Use these insights as tools for growth while recognizing that genuine intimacy transcends quantification.
